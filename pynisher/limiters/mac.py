"""
Useful info for invesetigating memory:
* MacOS uses Darwin-XNU as it's underlying operating system. This is easier to find as
just XNU.
* XNU uses a special memory manager called Mach-VM in its interface to which we have no
control
* Darwin-xnu: https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu
* resource.h: https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/main/bsd/sys/resource.h
* kern_resource.c
    https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/main/bsd/kern/kern_resource.c

For documentation on `setrlimit` and how to limit resources for MAC
** `setrlimit` **
* https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/main/bsd/man/man2/getrlimit.2

For documentation on MAC specific signal alarms:
** `signals` **
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/sigaction.2.html

Can't seem to limit memory, the only accepted rlimit towards memory is RLIMIT_DATA and
that seems to not work.

This module and the Linux limiter share almost identical code but we keep them seperate
incase of specific modules or changes needed
